## About
This was a project made to help track your devices. It gets the device's IP address, longitude and latitude, time, date, country, city, etc.
If you lose your devices, you could use this spyware to help get it's location.
**Do note, that the location data is NOT 100% accurate, but can provide an approximate location.**

The C++ version is probably the one you will want to use, as it is the fastest, compared to other versions.

This project is implemented in many programming languages so that you can run it in the language of your preference.
As of now, this project is implemented in
- JavaScript
- Python
- C++

more languages to be added, soon.
